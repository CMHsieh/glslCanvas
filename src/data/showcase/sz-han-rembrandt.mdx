## What is Chiaroscuro?

**Origin**

A method of painting which imparts a sense of very directional light falling on the subject.

**Usage**

The light source was often singular and resulted in dark shadows and backgrounds with the overall scene being highly contrasted between lights and darks.

## Three-point lighting

Three-point lighting is a standard method used in visual media such as theatre, video, film, still photography, computer-generated imagery and 3D computer graphics.

By using three separate positions, the photographer can illuminate the shot's subject (such as a person) however desired, while also controlling (or eliminating entirely) the shading and shadows produced by direct lighting.

➡️ Four-point lighting
